# [Roon](https://roonlabs.com) [Extension](node-roon-api) to provide [volume control](https://github.com/RoonLabs/node-roon-api-volume-control) for [Devialet](https://devialet.com/)'s [Phantom Premier](https://www.devialet.com/en-us/phantom-premier-speaker) via its UPnP implementation.

This extension connects to your Devialet Phantom via UPnP, and allows Roon to control it's volume in-app.

This can be useful for when you have your Phantom hooked up via it's optical or analog inputs.

Make sure to configure your Phantom (via Spark) to turn on UPnP support (even if it says beta).

After running this extension, it will automatically find your Phantoms.

To use this extension within Roon, go to the Roon zone that is playing to the Phantom, and go to device setup. Then change the volume control mechanism to be this extension.
